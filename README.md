Simple, clean and fast. Real time passenger information for Dublin's LUAS tram system.
# Simple-LUAS

This project uses the RTPI API supplied by Transport for Ireland for the Luas. Obviously there are a ton of real time apps out there for iOS and Android, as well as the official [Luas website](http://luas.ie/) - but my aim with this is to make a clean experience whilst also improving my dev skills.
