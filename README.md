Simple, clean and fast. Real time passenger information for Dublin's LUAS tram system.
# Simple LUAS

This project uses the RTPI API supplied by Transport for Ireland for the Luas. Obviously there are a ton of real time apps out there for iOS and Android, as well as the official [Luas website](http://luas.ie/) - but my aim with this is to make a clean experience whilst also improving my dev skills.

### API

The RTPI API is available here: <http://luasforecasts.rpa.ie/xml/get.ashx?action=forecast&stop=STS&encrypt=false>. You can find a list of the three character stop codes [here ( to be added )](https://shanehastings.eu/luas/faq.php).

### Feature List
